# MapGenerator
Map generator written for Love2D

Uses algorithm described [here](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/noise/) for spherical planet generation on a plane. 
Increased iterations lessens the amount of tesselation in the map, and map is seed based such that providing same seed produces the same map.

TODO:
GUI for adjusting parameters, remove all ocean maps
